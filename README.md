# Online Shop
> Basic online shop with cart and product filtration 

This is an online store project which offers the functionality of adding products to the cart for both registered and non-registered users (after logging in, the two carts merge). The quantity of products corresponds to warehouse stock, and once it runs out, the product becomes Out of Stock.
